   * Whether the cleaning thread will block on shuffle cleanup tasks.

   * When context cleaner is configured to block on every delete request, it can throw timeout
   * exceptions on cleanup of shuffle blocks, as reported in SPARK-3139. To avoid that, this
   * parameter by default disables blocking on shuffle cleanups. Note that this does not affect
   * the cleanup of RDDs and broadcasts. This is intended to be a temporary workaround,
   * until the real RPC issue (referred to in the comment above `blockOnCleanupTasks`) is
   * resolved.
